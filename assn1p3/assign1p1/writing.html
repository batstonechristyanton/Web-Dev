        The Turing test is not a good test for machine intelligence because now the test was originally created to be used to test Turings dream intelligent computer that could be programmed to act like a intelligent human being. In the modern years, AI is being used to label programs that are being created today this causing the label of AI being misused.  There has been no tangible progress in realizing machine intelligence the way turing has decided. The Chinese room insists that the computer can work like a human being. The story indicates that the people who keep sending notes of Chinese letters eventually gets the human in the room that is locked up to understand the information and process it with a recognizing manner of symbols which would then in the future become a way where the person in the room first not understanding the Chinese language eventually can speak it. The shadowing of this story claims that one day computers can learn things on its own and process information the self learning of the language of the human in the room could be the computer with an intelligent processing system(Halpern, 2006).

        Artificial intelligence is the outcome of Turing’s test that was created in search of AI. This test then got humans to create new forms of software designs that had self learning capability. These software’s were being corrected over time with new purpose. The purpose of these software’s is to make the lives of humans simpler due to the extra processing it can do that the human brain cannot in seconds.  The Artificial intelligence has many new applications currently that have been formed and these applications are being limited due to the capabilities of the current era and these AI software’s have many benefits and have some problems that could be corrected for the future.

        In our current world, Artificial- intelligences is being used in our phones as virtual personal -assistants, the Google Now and Siri are examples of the digital personal assistance that is available. These personal assistants make the lives of busy human beings simpler, while talking people can ask these personal assistants questions that would answer them in minutes as suppose to typing questions on the phone. These personal assistants are handy not for regular individuals but people who are disabled with out hands or legs, without eyes can use this personal assistant to get the job done. In video games AI, has been used to increase the complexity and effectiveness of the video games the notable individual personalities given to each non-player character. First person shooter games like call of duty and other ones are used to analyze their environments and how to act of objects.  Smart cars are also benefitting form the AI that is available in todays era, the dream of the self driving cars is moving closer and closer. The dream is to read a newspaper and be driven by the self driving car. The car would be able to look onto traffic on the road ahead it would be able to make decisions and this would later something the car would learn to process. Large retailers who are marketing products based on the searches we make are catering business to public on social media, have you noticed when you search something on google, this search some how shows up on your Facebook advertisement lists. These advertisements are AI induced research about you that is then used on social media like Facebook to market products that you search the night before. These are the new applications of AI in this current world. We have these new applications which are currently being developed to be used by individuals and some of these applications, like the self driving car needs work because it cannot be trusted because of the work it needs to be done.

      <p class="paragraph4">
        We are not currently close to creating true artificial intelligence, the problems today we face of AI is that we don’t have a vast amount of data to power deep learning systems. There is a lot of data to be processed and we do no have that information. The artificial agents on google use a lot of information that is online. Big firms like google and Facebook have a lot of data and the voice searches by the virtual assistant can search through all this due to the data that is available.  There could be many different forms of programs being written and unless there is data that google and Facebook has it cannot be tested properly because of the data not being present for the programs to work. Its hard for AI to be in the healthcare system do to confidentiality of patients and the AI that takes scans and that recognizes tumors you cannot force people to become sick to collect data. It would take another 60 years for us to have the correct amount of data to operate in manner where AI could use the information it must deep learn the information and recognize info on the patients.  Deep mind research indicates that there is no one way that AI can be trained to recognize objects and images. When google announced that Its deep mind can beat 49 Atari games it did beat games as they mentioned but each time the AI beat the Atari games it had to be reprogrammed for it to beat the game again. the deep mind forgot what it learnt the first time around about the game.

      <p class="paragraph5">
        Ai currently is known as the weak AI because it is a small form of what its capable of. The researchers are motivated of the benefits it is to offer to the world. The areas where there is benefits of AI is in economics and law and many other aspects like verification, validity, security, and control, if our laptop or any form of electronic is hacked this becomes a major issue to us then when AI is hacked. AI can control our automated car pacemaker and if this does get in the wrong hands then this can be devastating because it can then attack us. There is always question to whether the Stronger AI would ever be created because its ability to be intelligent. There has always been a stigma of the computer cannot feel anything emotional and cannot touch but this feeling also creates that one day if the strong AI is ever created this can attack us anytime because it would like to be like us or be smarter then its creator. 

        The problems of using AI is that it does not exhibit the emotions of a human being like love or hate and there is no reason to expect AI to become superior then us and eventually kill us all because it would think that we have it locked it into the non-tangible electronic world. When a weapon is created and the AI decided to use it against its creator, which us as humans for locking it up in the electronic world. AI would develop a destructive method for to achieve its goals. If for example, you ask an intelligent car to take you the airport as fast as it can, it would take you to the airport but along the line breaking the law and causing accidents or getting helicopters to follow you. If you get the AI to do something against the law and it does it for you but then when you tell the AI to stop because you are breaking the law it may forget to understand why and it may turn it against you saying it did what you asked and now you are frustrating me with overloading my system. A super intelligent AI would do right when we ask it to and accomplish the goals we have for it, but as soon as it has goals of its own then we as humans would have a problem against it because our interest would clash and then AI would be after us.

      <p class="parargraph6">Artificial Intelligence is an amazing topic we as humans have developed since Alan Turing’s time. This AI, have grown in many forms such as our cars, phones and our daily lives, this creation has made life much more efficient with easy accessibility to all kinds of humans with disabilities. Although, this AI can perform small tasks, but researchers have not developed the stronger form of AI due to lack of AI to recognize shapes, sizes, and capability of differentiating between hate and love, and can multi task. AI cannot remember how it cannot beat a game at once. AI can be used to our advantage as humans soon, currently we have flaws that need to be fixed and the amount of data that we have meets storage space so that AI can function to the fullest. </p>

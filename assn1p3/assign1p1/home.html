      Hello and Thanks for stopping by at my website.
    </p>

    <p class="paragraph2">
     My name is Batstone Christyanton and I am a third year Trent university student, working towards my degree in Computer science specializing in software engineering. Before attending Trent university I had originally attended  Seneca college to get my diploma in opticianry. I worked for Hakim optical as an Optician for 5 years in that process I had initially joined Trent university  to do my bachelors in biology.
   </p>

   <p class="paragraph3">
     
    Somewhere along the line fate had made its choice and I had realized that I did not like biology.  it seems I will be getting my degree in computer science. My passion towards computers has always been a clear path that I had not projected before due to my career as an optician. This leads back to high school where I enjoyed many of my computer courses that I had taken. When I was 11 my dad was studying to get his A+ but being a srilankan immigrant without the English language he was having trouble studying, where I became a translator for him and helped him understand some of the concepts. Ever since then we have done mini computer network setups in the house when windows 2000 server was a thing and have always built our Pc’s  and as a small business owner we sold them to. 

  </p>

  <p class="paragraph4">
    

    Later when everyone starting building there computers we decided to open a car customizing shop where we did all audio video and security system upgrades, with my dad being an electronic engineer back home it was an easy business transition for us. After noticing that the business was not doing well and since I was still in high school thats when i had moved on to getting my diploma in opticianry.
